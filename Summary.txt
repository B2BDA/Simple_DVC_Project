We need to create some directories.
- artifacts/
- src/utils

We can create a setup.py which can help us install necessary requirements for the project.
We can create a requirements.txt to store all the necessary python libraries.
Inside src, we can keep all the necessary pipelines/stage 
- load and save data, split data, train data and evaluate data.
Inside src/utils we can keep python files which can be used as common utility function in all the python code.
Inside the artifacts folder, we can have 
- raw data dir
- processed data dir
- reports
- saved models
In the root directory, we can have two files, params.yaml and dvc.yaml
- params.yaml consists of all the parameters required for the pipelines to run. 
- dvc.yaml consists of code that helps DVC creates a DVC DAG and helps dvc understands what to run when. 
We can also mention the dependency files which can be used as a trigger mechanism when changes are detected.
